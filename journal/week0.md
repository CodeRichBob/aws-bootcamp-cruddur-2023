# Creating a User
To create a User I followed the following steps as outlined in [this](https://www.iguazio.com/docs/latest-release/cluster-mgmt/deployment/cloud/aws/howto/iam-user-create/) tutorial.
- Log in to the AWS console and search IAM service
- Under the IAM dashboard, go to **Users** , then click on **Add Users** button to create a new user.
- Enter the User details eg name, and **Enable console access**
- **Set permissions** by adding using to either an existing group, or by creating a new group(This is an important step for security reasons as someone is able to set the user's priviledges) 
- Create the user
- Save the User's credentials (**Access key ID** and **Secret Access Key**)

# Install AWS CLI
